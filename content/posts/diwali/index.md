## Golden Temple


**Temple in India**

Spread over five days, Diwali is a celebration of good conquering evil, and light overcoming dark. The religious festival originates in India, and is marked around the world by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. This marble-and-gold-leaf temple is a central worship place for Sikhs, who visit during Diwali to celebrate "Bandi Chhor Divas." This day coincides with Diwali, but remembers Guru Hargobind and 52 others, who were released from prison in the early 1600s.


## Mustafa Centre


**Supermarket in Singapore**

In preparation for the first day of Diwali, known as Dhanteras, homes are cleaned and a flurry of shopping takes place. New outfits, gifts and sweets are bought and it is customary to buy gold or silver jewelry. "Deepavali," as it is known in Singapore, marks a major shopping season as people prepare for festivities, stocking up at malls like this one in Little India.


## Temple of the Emerald Buddha


**Wat in Bangkok, Thailand**

Diwali remembers the tale of Ramayana, an ancient epic, retold in wall paintings within this Thai temple complex. The story goes that Sita, a reincarnation of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, was stolen by an evil demon called Ravana, and had to be rescued by her husband, Lord Rama. The second day of Diwali celebrates Lord Rama's success in defeating the demon.


## Arulmigu Astalakshmi Temple


**Hindu temple in Chennai, India**

This temple honors the goddess Lakshmi, considered a key protagonist within this festive season. According to the Hindu faith, the third day of Diwali is known as Lakshmi Puja, and is a time when the goddess is worshipped. Associated with good fortune, she is welcomed into homes with rangoli, patterns drawn with flowers and chalks in doorways. Following in the footsteps of those who lit candles to guide Lord Rama and Sita home, simple clay lamps called diyas are lit during Diwali, guiding Lakshmi into homes.


## Kathmandu Durbar Square

In Nepal, Diwali is known as “Tihar,” and particular emphasis is placed on celebrating different animals. Over the first few days locals famously celebrate crows by offering them food, and dogs by marking their foreheads with a pigment dot, known as a tika.



## Belgrave Neighbourhood Centre


**Community center in Leicester, England**

The fifth and final day of Diwali is called Bhai Dooj, and it is a time to celebrate relationships with close family.

Across the UK families join these rituals, with some of the largest Diwali celebrations outside of India taking place here in Leicester.

## Dashrath Mahal Ayodhya


**Hindu temple in Ayodhya, India**
