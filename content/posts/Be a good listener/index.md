The art of listening involves all of our being.

You’d be amazed how much more confident you feel when you’re a good listener.
You find you can handle business and social situations confidently.

The art of good communication can be summarised in four points:

■ Be a good listener so you truly understand what others say to you. Good
listening earns genuine respect and admiration, and is one of the secrets of
popularity.

■ Have something good to say. Boring people make boring conversation.

■ Express yourself well. Use colourful, descriptive language. Make your con-
versation sound interesting.

■ Appeal to the emotions. There’s a wise saying: The head never hears until the
heart has listened.

Become a good listener and you’ll gain a reputation as a good conversationalist without
having to say very much at all.
